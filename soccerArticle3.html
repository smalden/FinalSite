        <p id="articleText">Morocco continued their remarkable World Cup 
            campaign by producing another shock result as 
            they defeated Portugal 1-0 to book a place in 
            the semi-final and leave Cristiano Ronaldo in tears.
            Portugal started the brighter of the two sides and 
            almost opened the scoring in the sixth minute, but
             Yassine Bounou made a fantastic stop to save Joao 
             Felix's close-range header. However, Morocco grew 
             into the game and deservedly took the lead on the
              stroke of half-time through Youssef En-Nesyri.Yahya
               Attiat-Allah's cross was headed home by the Sevilla 
               forward to give the North Africans a slender advantage
                heading into the interval. Portugal pushed to grab 
                a leveller, and came close through Bruno Fernandes 
                and Felix again, but couldn't find a way past Bounou.</p>
