        <img class="coverImage" src="Images/saudiwin.jpeg" alt="Team Saudi Wins Upset">
        <p id="articleText">Saudi Arabia performed the first real miracle of 
            the Qatar 2022 World Cup by defeating competition 
            favourites Argentina. Messi had opened the scoring
             just ten minutes in with a cool penalty, and as 
             Argentina put the ball in the net three more times 
             before the half time whistle – with every one being 
             ruled out for off-side – it was looking like one-way traffic.
            That said, it was a far from vintage performance from Argentina, 
            ultimately punished when Saleh Al Shehri latched onto a long ball 
            and lashed a left-foot shot into the far corner of Emi Martinez' 
            goal. It was Saudi Arabia's first effort - but it would not be
             their last. Just five minutes later, Salem Al Dawsari scored 
             one of the goals of the tournament to launch the Saudis into 
             an astonishing lead. An exceptional save at close range from 
             Mohammed Al Owais shortly after preserved the underdog’s lead, 
             and the Albiceleste failed to meaningfully threaten for the
              remainder of this astonishing match.
