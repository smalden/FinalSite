        <img src="Images/ufc284.jpeg" width="90%" alt="UFC 284 Announcement">
        <p id="articleText">For the first time since October 2019, the UFC will 
            be holding an event in Australia. Perth's RAC Arena
            has been confirmed as the host of UFC 284 on February 12.
            While the company may not have been on our shores for a
            few years, there's still plenty of talent from this part
            of the world lighting up the sport. Farah Hannoun of MMA 
            Junkie reports that Mullarkey and Nasrat Haqparast are 
            expected to share the Octagon at UFC 284, the upcoming
             pay-per-view event scheduled for Feb 12 at RAC Arena 
             in Perth, Australia. Both fighters have confirmed the
            bout on their respective social media accounts. Mullarkey 
            recently returned to the win column with a split decision 
            over Michael Johnson in a ‘Fight of the Night’ awarded appearance
             at UFC Vegas 58 this past July. Prior to that, the 28-year-old saw
              a two-fight win streak snapped after he suffered a second-round 
              TKO loss to Jalin Turner at UFC 272 in March. </p>
