             WIN AGAINST JARED GORDON</h1>

        <img class="coverImage" src="Images/paddywin.jpeg" alt="Paddy Clashes with Opponent">
        <p id="articleText">Paddy 'The Baddy' Pimblett earned a controversial
             unanimous points victory against Jared Gordon in
              their lightweight bout at UFC 282. Despite being
               unranked, the popular Liverpudlian capped a fine 
               year by coming out on top on the judges' scorecards
               in a close lightweight co-main event against his
               experienced American opponent at the T-Mobile Arena
               in Las Vegas on Saturday. Many booed Pimblett (20-3)
               winning 29-28 on all three judges' cards, while Gordon
               shook his head and laughed when the scores were announced.
               "Jared is tough, he's a tough man," Pimblett said. "He's 
               come back, hats off to him. I knew I won the first and 
               second so coasted in the third not wanting to take any 
               stupid risks." But the 27-year-old says he is unsure 
               when he will return to the octagon after suffering an 
               injury during the fight. "We'll see. I'm not gonna lie,
                I hurt my right foot in the first round. I'll need that
                 X-rayed," he said.
