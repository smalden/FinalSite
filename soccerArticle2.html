        <h1 id="headline">QATAR FIRST TEAM TO BE KNOCKED OUT</h1>

        <img class="coverImage" src="Images/qatarout.jpeg" alt="Team Quatar Eliminated">
        <p id="articleText">Qatar are the first team to be eliminated from the 2022
             World Cup on home soil after just two games of their
              campaign. The tournament hosts slipped to a second 
              successive defeat in Group A on Friday, losing 3-1 
              to Senegal despite a spirited effort. That loss came 
              after they were beaten by Ecuador 2-0 in their group 
              opener on Sunday and leaves them with no chance of 
              qualifying for the knockout phase after Ecuador and
               the Netherlands played out a 1-1 draw. Qatar do still
                have one final game to come on Tuesday, though even if 
                they managed to pull off a shock win over Netherlands, 
                they can only finish on a total of three points, which
                 is not enough to catch their group rivals. It is a disappointing
                  end for Qatar, who hoped to galvanise the same spirit 
                  previous hosts have shown when holding the tournament. </p>
