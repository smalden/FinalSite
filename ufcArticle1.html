        <p id="articleText">A new light heavyweight champion was not crowned 
           at UFC 282 after all. In the main event at T-Mobile 
            Arena in Las Vegas, Jan Blachowicz and Magomed Ankalaev 
            surprsingly fought to a split draw, with one judge 
            awarding Blachowicz the fight, one judge giving it to 
            Ankalaev, and the final judge scoring it a draw. Blachowicz
             vs. Ankalaev was the fifth draw in UFC championship history.
            Blachowicz (29-9-1 MMA, 12-6-1 UFC) admitted afterward that 
            he believed Ankalaev (18-1-1 MMA, 9-1-1 UFC) won. A frustrated
             Ankalaev was shocked with the outcome and even questioned if
              he wanted to fight for the UFC again.A stunning turn of events
               to say the least, considering Jiri Prochazka vacated the title
                prior to UFC 282 because of injury. For now, the 205-pounds
                 division is without a UFC champ.
