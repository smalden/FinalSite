        <img class="coverImage" src="Images/rodgersInjury.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers During Loss to Eagles">
        <p id="articleText">Quarterback Aaron Rodgers exited the Green Bay Packers’ loss Sunday night in Philadelphia because of what he called a rib injury, raising further questions about his NFL future. The four-time league MVP already was playing with a broken right thumb, and he and the Packers have been suffering through a mostly miserable season.
            <br><br>“The pain was intense,” Rodgers said during his postgame news conference at Lincoln Financial Field. “It still is. The pain was tough. And the breathing — I just couldn’t really breathe and couldn’t really rotate my upper body.”
            <br><br>Rodgers said he would undergo further testing Monday and, if a major injury is not found, he hopes to continue playing this season as long as the Packers have a chance to reach the playoffs.
            <br><br>“As long as I check out fine tomorrow, I expect to play [next] weekend,” Rodgers said. “As long as I check out okay tomorrow — I might not be able to go Wednesday [in practice]. But as long as there’s no major structural damage, I’ll try to get back out there.”
